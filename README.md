# Edolution
Evolution simulator project in Unity. This project aims to study various patterns and aspects of evolution as a concept (not necessarily bound to any field). 
# Background
I have developed 2 Evolution projects already during my high school years. Both of them yielded very interesting findings; for example, one of my societies developed blindness because, with good sight, males were organizing orgies and forgot to eat.
